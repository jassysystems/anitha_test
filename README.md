Assumptions
=================

I have assumed that the business has prioritised drivers and results as high risk and wants us to test
these end points. So I have written automated tests for these end points.


Running test
--------------
Install IntelliJ or any other IDE. Make sure to install Gherkin and Junit support in the IDE.

Clone the repo. Right Click on TestRunner class and Click Run.

or 

run mvn test from the terminal (Navigate to the repo location)

Result
------

Execution results are stored in folder target/result.
